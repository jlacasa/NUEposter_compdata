## An abstract from the Proceedings of the 2022 Nitrogen Use Efficiency Workshop

The critical nitrogen dilution curve (CNDC) is a relevant model underpinning the foundational knowledge for assessing nitrogen (N) diagnosis of major field crops around the globe. The CNDC relates plant N concentration (*%N*) to biomass (*W*), using a simple nonlinear function with two parameters. More precisely, the CNDC estimates the critical N concentration ($%N_C$) as the nutrient status needed to achieve maximum W at a certain point of the crop growing season. Thus, benchmarking current plant %N status to the $%N_C$ reference value, provides a reliable diagnostic whether a plant is N deficient, and if N fertilizer is necessary. Due to the practical importance of the CDNC, the parameters of the model should be estimated as accurately as possible from field data. Two contrasting frameworks have been proposed in the scientific literature for parameter estimation of the CNDC. The standard framework consists of fitting two statistical models sequentially (sequential framework). Recently, an alternative framework has been proposed to estimate the parameters in a single step, using a hierarchical Bayesian model (hierarchical framework). In this study, we compare both frameworks and assess their performances for a large range of experimental designs. We consider datasets with different numbers of sampling times (4, 8, 16), N fertilizer rates (3, 4, 5), and levels of accuracy (low, medium, high). Our results show that the hierarchical- outperforms the sequential- framework under combinations of tested factors. In addition, the sequential method tends to overestimate $%N_C$ and the parameter estimates resulted in poor statistical properties (e.g., increased bias, low coverage probability, and a greater sensitivity to the experimental design’s characteristics). A more systematic implementation of the hierarchical framework will reduce the risk of overfertilization and environmental footprint of this practice in our current agricultural systems.
