# Results  

## Simulation study  

Overall, the hierarchical model outperformed the sequential model in all aspects.  

**Table 1.** Relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) and percentage bias error (PBE, %) for A1 and A2 with the sequential and hierarchical frameworks, for different types of datasets with 5 N rates.

**Table 2.** Difference between absorbed N required to reach %N<sub>C</sub> as %N<sub>C</sub> (sequential) – %N<sub>C</sub> (hierarchical), and bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) in %N<sub>C</sub> estimation (in %) with *W*=10 Mg ha-1, for a selection of scenarios of different combinations of data.
