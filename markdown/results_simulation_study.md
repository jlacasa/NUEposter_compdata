## Simulation study  

Overall, the hierarchical model outperformed the sequential model in all aspects. We evaluated both frameworks under simulated conditions under different scenarios, with varying amount of N rates (3, 4, 5), amount of sampling times (4, 8, 16), and distribution of %N data with respect to %N<sub>C</sub> (few data above %N<sub>C</sub>, some data above %N<sub>C</sub>, many data above %N<sub>C</sub>). This resulted in a total of 27 scenarios where we compared the frameworks' performances.
